# The questionnaire of Chapter 1 Your deep learning journey

Do you need these for deep learning? 
1. Lots of math 
2. Lots of data 
3. Lots of expensive computers 
4. A PhD 
- No.

Name five areas where deep learning is now the best tool in the world. 

- Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
- Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
- Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
- Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
- Image generation:: Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
- Recommendation systems:: Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
- Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
- Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
- Other applications:: Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more...

What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron? 

Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)? 

What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks? 

What is a GPU? 

Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix. 

Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo? 
- We can not describe the recognition process step by step.

What did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”? 

What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called “weights”?

Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel’s view of a machine learning model. 

Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction? 

What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy? 

What do you need in order to train a model? 

How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model? 

Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model? 
- No

What is the difference between classification and regression?

What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them? 

What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set? 

Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? 
- No. If Always random, then you cannot compare the results.

What is overfitting? Provide an example.

What is a metric? How does it differ from loss? 

How can pretrained models help? 

What is the “head” of a model? 

What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?

Are image models useful only for photos? 

What is an architecture? 
- The function/model

What is segmentation? 

What is y_range used for? When do we need it? 

What are hyperparameters? 

What’s the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?
